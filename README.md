# 🕷️ WikiCrawler 9000™️


## 🤔 What is this?
WikiCrawler 9000™️ is a glorious Chrome Extension that:

Spawns itself upon your command.

Navigates your page like a caffeine-fueled intern.

Grabs each page’s juicy HTML content 🍖.

Sends it over to your loyal server at http://localhost:1337, because obviously that's where all good things happen.

Only goes down the rabbit hole, not up. Because we don’t need to revisit the past—we’re crawling toward the future. 📚➡️🕳️

## 🧠 How does it work?
You click a button. (Such power. Wow.)

It starts on the page you're looking at and begins exploring every link that:

Is on the same domain 🌐

Lives deeper in the hierarchy (think folders inside folders... inside folders).

It sends every page’s full HTML to your localhost:1337 backend, where you probably have some magic going on like Elasticsearch indexing or a black hole.

It does not visit the same place twice. It has standards.

It skips links that only change the #hash unless it's literally the same page with some extra spice.

## ⚙️ Installation (for developers who like danger)
Clone this repo. Or don’t. I’m not your boss.

Go to chrome://extensions in Chrome.

Turn on Developer Mode (you rebel).

Click “Load unpacked” and choose this folder.

Visit your internal wiki.

Click the extension icon and smash that Start Crawl button.
